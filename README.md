CodedOptions
============

Usage
-----

Just a way to clean up my normal way to deal with coded options.  Basically,
in a Rails controller, it turns

    coded_options :state, %w(initial active closed)

into

    STATES = %w(initial active closed)
    STATE_OPTIONS = [["initial", 0], ["active", 1], ["closed", 2]]

    def state
      return unless state_id
      STATES[state_id]
    end

The STATE_OPTIONS array is perfect for select tags.  You can also use this in
a plain Ruby object as follows:

    require "coded_options"

    class Foo
      extend CodedOptions
      attr_accessor :state_id, :type_id
      coded_options :state => %w(active closed), :type => %w(stupid awesome)
    end

    foo = Foo.new
    foo.type_id = 1
    foo.type          #=> awesome

If you want to use this with MongoDB, just add

    extend CodedOptions

to your model.

Installation
------------

To install into a Rails 3 app just add this to your `Gemfile`:

    gem "coded_options"

and for Rails 2 apps you will want to install it as a plugin:

    ./script/plugin install git://github.com/jasondew/coded_options.git

Enjoy!
